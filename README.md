# Turing
Visualization for busy beaver things


Uncomment line 63 and put the intended width of your visualization in (divided by two) and your rules

Rules formatting follows this document: https://nickdrozd.github.io/2020/10/04/turing-machine-notation-and-normal-form.html

Example: 1LD
1: Replace current spot with a 1
L: Move Head to the left
D: Refer next to Rule D

Some example rulesets from wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver#Visualizations) are commented at the bottom, alongside my recomended width for each
Also linked is Skelet 1, which will run forever. Beware
